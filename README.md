Some of my project repositories:
 - **Wordcloud**
  Java Application that generates a wordcloud from a text file that is input by the user. Parses a file or URl input and creates a PNG image which depicts the most commonly occurring words in decreasing size. User must input decide whether to read text from either a txt file or a URL source, inputting either the file path, or the URL respectively. Application will then output a PNG file, which the user names, depicting a wordcloud using the most commonly occurring words in the text.

 - **Convolution**
  This Java project asks the user for an image, input as the images file path on the user's computer. The program will then ask the user to choose the number of the filter which will be used to filter the image. The user is then asked to input the file path with which they would like to save the image. The filtered image will then be saved in this location on the user's computer and will be able to accessed in their files.

 - **InsuranceCalculatorTestSuite**
  Java application designed to calculate insurance premium of a driver based on their age and number of accidents they have been in. Code was refactored from sample code given in proect brief to best implemtent functionality. JUnit automated test suite implemented to test methods of calculating insurance premium. Project built using Eclipse IDE and is tested using 'Run as JUnit Test'.

 - **SortingAlgorithms**
  Java application which benchmarks different sorting algorithms, rating them against one another in terms of Big-O time complexity. Algorithms displayed are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort and Counting Sort. Array of random numbers, of different sizes are generated using math.random, and the average time taken for each of the sorting algorithms to sort these arrays is calculated. The results are then printed in table format.

 - **NetworkChat**
  The purpose of this program is to develop a network based chat application using java, and java socket API. The program allows the user, or the ‚Äúclient‚Äù to communicate with the server. The ServerSide class is responsible for listening for a connection and accepts it. It also returns the host IP address. It then runs a runnable thread which will implement the functions outlined in the ServerThread class. One of these functions is initializing the end to end connection of sockets from the server and client side.
